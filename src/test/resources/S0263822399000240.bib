abstract = "A general solution for two dimensional stress distribution around triangular holes in isotropic plate and orthotropic plate with oriented fibers and multilayered symmetric laminates is presented. Generalized plane stress with an equivalent single layer approach is adopted. Uniaxial, biaxial and shear stresses at infinity are considered in the general solution for arbitrary biaxial loading. Tangential shear, uniform pressure around the hole are considered in other solutions. Results are obtained for single layered and multilayered plates of graphite/epoxy and other materials. The solution is verified with existing results in the literature. Although the basic equations are taken from Savin, the zero stress boundary condition on the hole in case of arbitrary biaxial loading is obtained explicitly using the novel method of Ukadgaonker."
