abstract = "The best values of fiber volume fractions, fiber arrangements, and cut-out orientations in an orthotropic infinite plate weakened by a polygonal discontinuity of regular and complex geometry are investigated in the present work. Considering the stress concentration factor as a fitness minimization function, the genetic algorithm is employed and, elastic constants and stresses are computed utilizing the Mori-Tanaka theory and the Muskhelishvili’s complex variable method, respectively. The upshot of present work shows a substantial impact of fiber volume fraction, fiber arrangement and, corner radius and orientation of cut-out, on values of stress concentration factor for various in-plane loading conditions. Furthermore, the database of the complex constants used in the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping to develop distinct complex shapes is also reported."
